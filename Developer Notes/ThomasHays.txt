Progress made through Feb 3rd - March 25th:
The inital progress that was made on VRetina was majorly concerned with getting an initial project setup in Unity. 
A VR test environment was made with a sample eyeball shape in the Unity Scene. I tweaked and toyed with  Unity build settings
to see if we could successfully build a proper VR google cardboard application to a mobile device. Using a a teammates mobile 
Android device, we were able to run a successfull VR version of the app

Progress made through March 25th - April 21st:
Most of the progress made in the latter half of the class has been based on the correspondance with Paras and what his expectations
for ther app are. I have mostly been working on the UI reticle and the Mac build settings. I have also spent time unsuccessfully 
pursuing an implementation for component highlighting on the eyeball image
